### What are Generative Adversarial Networks

* Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling
using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is
an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and
learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to
generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
* GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised
learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new
examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the
domain) or fake (generated).
* The two models are trained together in an adversarial zero-sum
game until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model
is generating plausible examples.
